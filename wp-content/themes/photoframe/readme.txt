=======================================
=== Photo Frame 1.0 WordPress Theme ===
=======================================

To show the special title and custom photo, your web server should have GD 
Library support. Ask your web hosting provider to see if they have this feature. 

But don't worry, if your web server does not support GD Library, it will still 
work with the default title and photo. 

Default font for the Blog Title: Arial, 32px

Default photo: Butterfly image

How to customize the photo: 
1. Upload your images into the /custom/ folder.
2. Only *.jpg format are accepted.
3. Image size is 300x240 and above. If the image size is bigger than 300x240, 
   the program will crop and resize the image.
4. The uploaded image will show up in the center frame.
5. If you upload more than 2 images, one of the images will show up in the center 
   frame randomly.
